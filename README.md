## General Information
- Boom Bikes is a US based bike sharing provider has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. They wants to cater the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers.
- Boom Bikes is trying to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- We will find "which variable is significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes" and "how well those variables describe the bike demands".
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, Boom Bikes has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.
